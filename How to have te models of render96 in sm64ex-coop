crédits to @unrealsm64 in YouTube 

go to this link: https://github.com/Render96/ModelPack/releases/tag/3.25

and dowload the package render96DynOS_v3.25.7z

unzip the 7z file and copy it to the sm64ex-coop 
folder called DynOs if you don't have it create it and 
inside this there should be another one called packs and that's it. 
Your sm64ex-coop will open and you'll see the render96ex models. 
If you haven't activated the dynos pack, it works on both PC and Android.

and disfrute to this módel pack.
